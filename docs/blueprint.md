## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Violet (#800080) to establish a magical and engaging atmosphere.
- Background color: Light lavender (#E6E6FA), a desaturated version of violet that ensures comfortable contrast.
- Accent color: Indigo (#4B0082) to highlight key elements like call-to-action buttons, achievement notifications and progress indicators, adding visual interest and guiding the user's focus effectively.
- Body and headline font: 'Space Grotesk', a proportional sans-serif with a computerized, techy, scientific feel, suitable for headlines and short amounts of body text; if longer text is anticipated, use this for headlines and 'Inter' for body. This font aligns with the application's technological aesthetic while ensuring readability.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' for any instances displaying code or numerical data.
- Utilize flat, vector-based icons with a consistent line weight, reflecting the chosen theme. Icons should be simple and intuitive, providing clear visual cues without overwhelming the user interface. Icons are used for main operations: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Employ rounded corners (rounded-2xl, rounded-3xl) on UI elements and cards to soften the interface and provide a welcoming feel. Responsive grid layouts will be used to adapt seamlessly to various screen sizes, maintaining consistency and usability across devices. A backdrop blur effect can add depth and focus to specific areas of the app.
- Implement smooth transitions, subtle hover effects, and animated feedback using Framer Motion. Animations are used to reinforce user actions, provide engaging feedback, and guide users through the learning process in an unobtrusive and enjoyable way.
